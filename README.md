# C-Activity-1-SO
Implement a C program that processes a plain text file containing a sequence of integers. The file is structured in such a way that the first integer, N, specifies the number of subsequent integers, each of which is presented on a separate line. These integers, denoted as k_i, meet the k_iâ‰¤10,000 condition. The program must calculate the total sum of these integers and measure the execution time of the read and add operation.
Estimate the variance, standard deviation, and median of the data.
What is the value that is most repeated in the integers read?
You can improve by using binaries and adding different functionalities depending on the execution parameters.
